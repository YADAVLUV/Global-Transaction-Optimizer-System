# Global Transaction Optimizer System README

This system minimizes the number of transactions among multiple banks across different regions, each utilizing various payment methods. A central World Bank, supporting all payment methods, acts as an intermediary between banks that do not share a common payment mode.

## Getting Started

Let's consider an example with the following banks:

- **World_Bank** (Central Bank)
- **First_National_Bank**
- **Union_Bank**
- **Pacific_Bank**
- **Commonwealth_Bank**
- **Morgan_Stanley**

### Transaction Details

Below are the payments to be made:

| Debtor Bank           | Creditor Bank           | Amount  |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| Morgan_Stanley        | World_Bank              | Rs 100  |
| Morgan_Stanley        | First_National_Bank     | Rs 300  |
| Morgan_Stanley        | Union_Bank              | Rs 100  |
| Morgan_Stanley        | Pacific_Bank            | Rs 100  |
| Commonwealth_Bank     | World_Bank              | Rs 300  |
| Commonwealth_Bank     | Union_Bank              | Rs 100  |
| World_Bank            | First_National_Bank     | Rs 400  |
| First_National_Bank   | Union_Bank              | Rs 200  |
| Union_Bank            | Pacific_Bank            | Rs 500  |

### Payment Modes

Each bank supports a specific set of payment methods, while the World Bank supports all available methods:

- **World_Bank** - Google_Pay, AliPay, Paytm
- **First_National_Bank** - Google_Pay, AliPay
- **Union_Bank** - AliPay
- **Pacific_Bank** - Google_Pay, Paytm
- **Morgan_Stanley** - Paytm
- **Commonwealth_Bank** - AliPay, Paytm

### Optimization Strategy

To optimize the transactions:

1. Calculate the net amount for each bank:
   \[
   \text{Net Amount} = [\text{Total Credits}] - [\text{Total Debits}]
   \]
2. Identify the bank with the maximum debt and the bank with the maximum credit that share a common payment method.
3. Execute the transaction using the minimum of the absolute values of the debt and credit.

Repeat the process until all debts are settled.
